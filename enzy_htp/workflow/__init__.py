This module contains classes and configs to assemble JSON format task configuration files 
written in a specified format into a computing task, and supports saving the task as a binary file, 
re-reading the binary file, and reloading the task by reading the updated configuration file after the task 
exits with an error, as well as to continue execution from the updated/error-reporting position.
