# Benchmarking

This directory contains benchmarking for `enzy_htp` and its abilities.


## TODO 
+ prioritize enzyme substrate complex
+ make sure its really an enzyme
+ make sure the substrate structure... make sure its not just an inhibitor
+ simply having the substrate inside will catalyze, will not be able to get the 
actual enzyme structure for
+ need to read up on this
+ make sure the ligand is the actual substrate
+ co crystallizing reagent
+ what is a substrate
+ get XSEDE account
